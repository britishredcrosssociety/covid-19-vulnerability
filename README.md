# Prototype COVID-19 vulnerability index for the UK
The COVID-19 vulnerability index is composed of *clinical vulnerability* and *social vulnerability*. Clinical vulnerability will help identify who is likely to transition from 'social distancing' to 'self-isolating/quarantining' and back, allowing us to account for the potential differing needs of those two groups. Social vulnerability will identify whether someone has unmet needs by modelling their existingÂ social support and isolation.

This will map vulnerability at the geographical levels of Local Authorities (for coordinating with local government, statutory bodies etc.) and wards (which are well-defined and meaningful communities, allowing for more nuanced targeting).

Clinical vulnerability includes:

- [Prevalence of underlying conditions](https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/prevalence):
  - Estimated prevalence of CHD
  - Estimated prevalence of Heart failure
  - Estimated prevalence of COPD
  - Estimated prevalence of peripheral arterial disease

Social vulnerability includes:

- [Community Needs](https://ocsi.uk/2020/01/15/community-needs-index-your-questions-answered/): connectedness; engagement; assets
- [Deprivation](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2019): income, employment, barriers to housing and services, environmental
