# Prorotype COVID-19 vulnerability index for the UK
The COVID-19 vulnerability index is composed of *clinical vulnerability* and *social vulnerability*. Clinical vulnerability will help identify who is likely to transition from 'social distancing' to 'self-isolating/quarantining' and back, allowing us to account for the potential differing needs of those two groups. Social vulnerability will identify whether someone has unmet needs by modelling their existingÂ social support and isolation.

This will map vulnerability at the geographical levels of Local Authorities (for coordinating with local government, statutory bodies etc.) and wards (which are well-defined and meaningful communities, allowing for more nuanced targeting).

Clinical vulnerability includes:

- Prevalence of underlying conditions
- Population over 70

Social vulnerability includes:

- Community Needs: connectedness; engagement; assets
- Deprivation: economic; access to housing and services
