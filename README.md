# British Red Cross COVID-19 vulnerability index for the UK
The COVID-19 vulnerability index combines multiple sources of (mostly) open data to identify vulnerable areas and groups within Local Authorities and neighbourhoods (wards and Middle Layer Super Output Areas).

The Index currently maps clinical vulnerability (underlying health conditions), health/wellbeing vulnerability (including mental health and loneliness), economic vulnerability, and social vulnerability (including barriers to housing and services, poor living environment).

There's more information about our approach, current indicators and data sources, and forthcoming vulnerabilities in [this open document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aWpzgvLKGEF5Ay_xVps17nnbT1zIEki7RGIIJXL5APo/edit#).

## Maps

- Vulnerability in Middle Layer Super Output Areas (MSOAs): https://arcg.is/1814DT
- Vulnerabilty in wards: https://arcg.is/5Hf1u
- Vulnerability in Local Authorities: https://arcg.is/15LST1

## Using the vulnerability index
If you don't want to grapple with the code, we've already produced several outputs (descriptions of the variables are [available here](https://github.com/britishredcrosssociety/covid-19-vulnerability/blob/master/metadata.md)):

- the overall COVID-19 Vulnerability Index in .csv format for [MSOAs](https://github.com/britishredcrosssociety/covid-19-vulnerability/raw/master/output/vulnerability-MSOA.csv), [wards](https://github.com/britishredcrosssociety/covid-19-vulnerability/blob/master/output/vulnerability-ward.csv) and [Local Authorities](https://github.com/britishredcrosssociety/covid-19-vulnerability/blob/master/output/vulnerability-LA.csv)
- the Vulnerability index in .geojson format for [MSOAs](https://github.com/britishredcrosssociety/covid-19-vulnerability/raw/master/output/vulnerability-MSOA.geojson), [wards](https://github.com/britishredcrosssociety/covid-19-vulnerability/blob/master/output/vulnerability-ward.geojson) and [Local Authorities](https://github.com/britishredcrosssociety/covid-19-vulnerability/blob/master/output/vulnerability-LA.geojson)

## Running the code / recreating the index

You'll need to install R and ideally RStudio. Run the following to install all necessary packages:

```
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "readxl", "janitor", "xml2", "Hmisc", "sf", "rmapshaper", "httr", "classInt"))
```

- Run the code in `create vulnerability index - MSOA.r` to create the overall index for Middle Layer Super Output Areas
- Run the code in `create vulnerability index - LA.r` to create the overall index for Local Authorities (this aggregates the Index from MSOAs up into LAs and adds in a few other LA-level indicators)
