# Metadata Instructions

## Generate a template of indicators
Each time the VI is updated (by either the removal or addition of indicators), run the `metadata-template.R` file to generate a list of the current indicators in use. Where possible this file will attempt to guess the domains of indicators based on row index. This will need manually checking for accuracy, but should save some time. Currently, templates are generated for the overall VI, and the bespoke food and hardship fund indices. These files are saved with a `_template.csv` suffix in the `/output` folder.

## Find sources
The generated template files will need the sources and dates adding manually. To retrieve matches from the last iteration of the metadata files, run the `metadata-match-sources.R` file. This should match all sources that were in the last iteration of the indices, requiring only the new indicators to have their sources and dates inputted.

*Note:* The newly generated metadata template files are saved with a `_template.csv` suffix to differentiate them from the original metadata files. To overwrite the existing metadata files after merging the sources, the final block of code will need un-commenting. It has been designed this way to prevent accidental overwriting of the original metadata files.

## Output
The metadata is saved as `.csv` files in the `/output` folder at the root directory.
