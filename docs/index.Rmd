To help focus help on the most vulnerable people whose needs aren't being met, we are developing a COVID-19 Vulnerability Index.

The Index consist of the following:

- Clinical vulnerability
- Other health/wellbeing needs
- Economic/financial vulnerability
- Social vulnerability (including physical/geographical isolation)

[This document describes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aWpzgvLKGEF5Ay_xVps17nnbT1zIEki7RGIIJXL5APo/edit#) what's currently available in the index and what we're considering adding in the future.
