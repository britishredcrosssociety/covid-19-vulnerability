# This is a test file to experiment with sensitivity analysis for varying domain weights.
# This file has been written to use the "create vulnerability index - MSOA - England.r" file.
# Other files can be exchanged in its place, but the 'Load data' section needs updating
# accordingly.

# ---- Load libraries ----
library(tidyverse)

# ---- Load data ----
# # Source MSOA England file up to line 326, just before the VI is created
# source(textConnection(read_lines("create vulnerability index - MSOA - England.r",
#                                  n_max = 326)))

# ---- Weights ----
# Create a tibble of weights to iterate over
# Other ideas: 1. use Dirichlet distrubtion to generate weights: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gtools/index.html
#              2. Just use runif() and divide by sum() e.g., x <- runif(3) then x/sum(x)

crossing(clinical_weight = c(0, .25, .5, .75, 1),
         health_weight   = c(0, .25, .5, .75, 1),
         economic_weight = c(0, .25, .5, .75, 1),
         social_weight   = c(0, .25, .5, .75, 1)) %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  filter(sum(clinical_weight,
             health_weight,
             economic_weight,
             social_weight) == 1)

# do rowwise count and filter any columns when count of 0 > 2 to remove any rows where more
# than two indicators are varying

# ---- Iterate ----
# Iterate over each row of weighs_tibble, inputting weights into calc_domain_scores
# Store result in new column of weights_tibble (nested data structure - i.e., one tibble per row)

# ---- Plot ----
